This is to be further tested by medical research teams with access to larger numbers of COVID-19 cases who might originate from a broad geographical distribution with different altitudes. We suggest, therefore, considering patients' epidemiological information (e.g., birthplace and residential history) when implementing precision management of CVD patients with COVID-19, to enhance mortality risk reduction.</p>\n<h1>Links</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062020300840?via%3Dihub\">Towards precision management of cardiovascular patients with COVID-19 to reduce mortality</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5cqXGPW2NFt6hLjZ-KLj_g\">Wechat pushing article by ISLE</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Picture</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0033062020300840-gr1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",
