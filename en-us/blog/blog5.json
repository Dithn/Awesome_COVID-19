With the pandemic of COVID-19, I built up a website, &quot;Awesome of COVID-19&quot;, which collected the related resources of COVID-19 researches. This article is the tutorial of this website.</p>\n<p>Snap spot of the website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588875068865dsydles6.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883152411532qwf6c.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://covid19.gisersqdai.top/en-us/index.html\">Url of the Weibsite? Click it</a></p>\n<h1>1 The tutorial of the website</h1>\n<p>I developed this website by <a href=\"https://github.com/txd-team/docsite\">docsite</a>. The website consists of four pages including Home, Resources, Work, and Community. Besides, there are two buttons including language and search.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588875408067xfe6agy5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once you click the 'language' button, the language of this website will convert to another language (Chinese/English).</p>\n<p>The search button could be used for searching the correlated information in the Google search engine.</p>\n<p>As for another four buttons, we could explore the website of home, resources, work, and community according to clicking the corresponding button. We will introduce the four detailed pages in the next section.</p>\n<h2>1 Homepage</h2>\n<p>The page of Home includes six parts. The first part is the title, and introduction of this website. Besides, it also include the two buttons, 'Quick Start', and 'View on Github'.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/15888761764255iga0je1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once you click the 'Quick Start' button, you will jump to the 'ISLE' page of this website.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the source code of this website is stored by the Github repository, <a href=\"https://github.com/GISerDaiShaoqing/Awesome_COVID-19\">Awesome COVID-19</a>. If you click the 'View on Github' button, you will see all the source code of this website.</p>\n<p>The second part is the overview of the COVID-19 time series data. You could explore the time series plot of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. The plot was generated by Python language and Matplotlib. Besides, I also list all the sources of COVID-19 data that were used for generating the plot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/15888767843028v9j9qfd.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The third part list all the possible research topics of our modeling analysis of COVID-19 including Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology, GIS, Satellite and Remote Sensing, GPS and Sensors, Statistics, and Machine Learning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588877020997d0n2h936.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The fourth part shows the snap spot of a COVID-19 shiny app that was developed by me. You could explore the dashboard shiny app of COVID-19 by clicking the 'READ MORE' button. The detailed information about this Shiny app will be introduced in the next sections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588877169771zgbe5hy0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The fifth part is the list of contributors.

I divided the resources into different types including ISLE, Resources hub, Academic paper letter and news, Clinic Medicine Resources, Virology and Biology Resources, Epidemiology Resources, Comprehensive Research, Economic, Urban planning and Governance correlated Resources, Data, Visualization, Platform, Tools, Organizations, Journal special issues, Competitions, Lecture, Funding application, and Sustainable cities &amp; mobility. I will introduce the detailed information about these resources by a short sentence. Besides, the resources include both Chinese and English resources.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/158887913981511mk846l.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ISLE means the <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU5Njk2NjI5OQ==&amp;mid=100000007&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=22a079e6bf2c7d7ffc69b221d38e54fe&amp;chksm=7e5beff3492c66e59a7d034aef8e1b999e3e861faa43164f4ae8d3431a4514107f52da37e2e2&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=&amp;sharer_sharetime=1584355634880&amp;sharer_shareid=cc522eb07e997d352cfce26bb80d69ec#rd\">International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE)</a>, which was built up by my supervisor <a href=\"https://research.utwente.nl/en/persons/peng-jia\">Prof.Jia Peng</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resources hub includes the resources provided by the Journal, University, Institute, Company, WHO, CDC, and other correlated department.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588880077358kpvkepee.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academic paper letter and news include the academic letter of a published paper or scientific reports, and the news about COVID-19.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588880411475yndxf1c0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clinic Medicine Resources include the studies about radiology and clinic medicine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588880473473g0epkhnz.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Virology and Biology Resources include the studies about the virology and biology that developed from the laboratory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Epidemiology Resources include the studies about the modeling spreading analysis, epidemiological analysis, risk assessment, and evaluation intervention of COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588881062153s5n44qh4.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Comprehensive Research includes the studies about cross-disciplinary research or different aspects of COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economic, Urban planning and Governance correlated Resources include the studies about economic, urban planning, and governance for the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data, Visualization, Platform, Tools include the data, visualization, platform and tools of COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588882201162hd423hs8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Organizations include the new organization of COVID-19 which is built up during the pandemic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Journal special issues include the related specials of COVID-19 in different journals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competition includes the competitions about the COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lecture includes the lecture, speech, and course of COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Funding application includes the application of funding which is related to COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustainable cities &amp; mobility is an open volunteer organization for the sustainable development of China which was built up by Daizong Liu.

I used the data which is collected by the Johns Hopkins University to construct a real-time dashboard of COVID-19 including the map of the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by mapbox), the interactive scatter plot of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases time-series data (developed by plotly), and the rank of the top 10 serious countries during the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883152411532qwf6c.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Besides, I developed a single dashboard for the COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in China including the map of the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by mapbox), and the interactive Voronoi Treemap of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by D3).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883639845kse7quan.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Finally, I design the interactive rank list of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. You could type the random number n (n is from 0 to 187) in the box and show the detailed information of the top serious n countries during the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883685908nndwx585.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1>3 Further Work</h1>\n<p>The further work of COVID-19 is still working on.</p>\n",
