# Implications

In conclusion, the alignment between our postulated clinical mechanisms and epidemiological estimates, despite some confounding factors, enables us to propose a novel hypothesis between patients of high-altitude origin and their lower mortality risk of COVID-19. This is to be further tested by medical research teams with access to larger numbers of COVID-19 cases who might originate from a broad geographical distribution with different altitudes. We suggest, therefore, considering patients' epidemiological information (e.g., birthplace and residential history) when implementing precision management of CVD patients with COVID-19, to enhance mortality risk reduction.
