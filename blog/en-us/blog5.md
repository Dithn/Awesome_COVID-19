My Ph.D. project will focus on the application of spatial technology in Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology. With the pandemic of COVID-19, I built up a website, "Awesome of COVID-19", which collected the related resources of COVID-19 researches. This article is the tutorial of this website.

Snap spot of the website.

# 1 The tutorial of the website
I developed this website by [docsite](https://github.com/txd-team/docsite). The website consists of four pages including Home, Resources, Work, and Community. Besides, there are two buttons including language and search. 

![](http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588875408067xfe6agy5.png)

Once you click the 'language' button, the language of this website will convert to another language (Chinese/English). 

The search button could be used for searching the correlated information in the Google search engine.

As for another four buttons, we could explore the website of home, resources, work, and community according to clicking the corresponding button. We will introduce the four detailed pages in the next section.

## 1 Homepage

The page of Home includes six parts. The first part is the title, and introduction of this website. Besides, it also include the two buttons, 'Quick Start', and 'View on Github'.  

![](http://blog.gisersqdai.top/15888761764255iga0je1.png)

Once you click the 'Quick Start' button, you will jump to the 'ISLE' page of this website.

On the other hand, the source code of this website is stored by the Github repository, [Awesome COVID-19](https://github.com/GISerDaiShaoqing/Awesome_COVID-19). If you click the 'View on Github' button, you will see all the source code of this website.

The second part is the overview of the COVID-19 time series data. You could explore the time series plot of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. The plot was generated by Python language and Matplotlib. Besides, I also list all the sources of COVID-19 data that were used for generating the plot.

The third part list all the possible research topics of our modeling analysis of COVID-19 including Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology, GIS, Satellite and Remote Sensing, GPS and Sensors, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

The fourth part shows the snap spot of a COVID-19 shiny app that was developed by me. You could explore the dashboard shiny app of COVID-19 by clicking the 'READ MORE' button. The detailed information about this Shiny app will be introduced in the next sections.

The fifth part is the list of contributors. If you want to become the contributors to the website, please contact me via E-mails and fork my Github repository.

The last part lists the quick links of correlated websites and resources. Besides, I also provide a globe which could show the location of the visitors of the website.

## 2 Resources
The resources page consists of various research resources that I collected. I divided the resources into different types including ISLE, Resources hub, Academic paper letter and news, Clinic Medicine Resources, Virology and Biology Resources, Epidemiology Resources, Comprehensive Research, Economic, Urban planning and Governance correlated Resources, Data, Visualization, Platform, Tools, Organizations, Journal special issues, Competitions, Lecture, Funding application, and Sustainable cities & mobility. I will introduce the detailed information about these resources by a short sentence. Besides, the resources include both Chinese and English resources.

![](http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588882561034l1dol7ff.png)

The spatial lifecourse epidemiology is the main theory of our team for supporting the analysis of COVID-19. I list the two main directions of our study for this pandemic of COVID-19 including the map of COVID-19, and modeling analysis of COVID-19. I also list the possible keywords for our study.

# 2 COVID-19 Shiny app
I used R and Shiny correlated packages to develop a COVID-19 Shiny app to display the pandemic of COVID-19. I used the data which is collected by the Johns Hopkins University to construct a real-time dashboard of COVID-19 including the map of the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by mapbox), the interactive scatter plot of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases time-series data (developed by plotly), and the rank of the top 10 serious countries during the pandemic of COVID-19.

![](http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883152411532qwf6c.png)

Besides, I developed a single dashboard for the COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in China including the map of the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by mapbox), and the interactive Voronoi Treemap of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases (developed by D3).

![](http://blog.gisersqdai.top/1588883639845kse7quan.png)

Finally, I design the interactive rank list of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. You could type the random number n (n is from 0 to 187) in the box and show the detailed information of the top serious n countries during the pandemic of COVID-19.
